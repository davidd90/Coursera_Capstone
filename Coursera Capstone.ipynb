    "The value of an apartment depends on more than the location and the features of a apartment.\n",
    "It also depends on the neighbourhood and the mobility. The aim of this project is to analyse the quality of a neighbourhood and the effect on the apartment rent.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example if an investor has a list of apartments which are available for sale he would probably only want to invest in an apartment that is located in a good neighboorhood. Evaluating the neighbourhood requires a lot of local knowledge or some research about it. \n",
    "If the quality of the neighbourhood could be evaluated by the foursquare data instead, this could save a lot of time and would help to evaluate the apartments automatically.\n"
